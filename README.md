# Digit-Recognizer

This repo contains Digits.py, which has a well commented code to impleament Digit Recognizer using Deep Learning


(1)data.zip contains data files requried for this repo                                                                  
(2)data_model contains three model trained on this data dataset                                         

Ensemble Learning is used to improve the accuracy of the model
